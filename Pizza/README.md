## Files Created

- `shipping_details.json` - Stores your shipping information for future orders

## Notes

- The browser window will remain open for debugging purposes

- Supported zip codes are validated before starting the ordering process

## Troubleshooting

- If ChromeDriver issues occur, ensure Chrome and ChromeDriver versions match
- For timeout errors, check your internet connection
- If elements aren't found, the website structure may have changed
