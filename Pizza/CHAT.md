> Build a python script that uses selenium to automate the process of ordering pizza from capripizzeria.hu.

> First, greet the user and ask for a zip code to make sure that they will be able to order a pizza in the end.
> 
> The supported zip codes are the following:
> 
> 3035, 3036, 3200, 3211, 3212, 3213, 3214, 3231, 3232, 3261, 3281, 3292.

> If the zip is not on the list, warn the user that they will probably not be able to order and ask if they want to proceed or exit.

> If they proceed, store the zip code for later.
> 
> First, get the list of pizzas from #URL: https://capripizzeria.hu/product-category/pizza/page/1/?count=36, increasing the page until it returns 404 and store the name and link of each pizza found in ".product_cat-pizza > h3 > a" elements and asks the user which pizza they would like to order. If there is no exact match, use fuzzywuzzy to find the closest match and ask if that's what the user meant.
> 
> Then visit the link and get the size options from the select element with the "yith-wapo-1" id. If there are multiple options, ask the user which one they want, the default being the one with the selected attribute.
> 
> Then ask hom many they want, the default being 1, and enter it in the input element with the "qty" class.
> 
> Finally add it to the cart by pressing the button with the class "single_add_to_cart_button".
> 
> Ask the user if they would like to order more. If yes, ask for the name of the pizza and start over. If no, navigate to #URL: https://capripizzeria.hu/checkout/ if the shipping details were previously saved to a json file, ask if they want to use the same details.
> 
> If not, ask for the details one by one and store them in a json file.
> 
> The details needed:
> 
> - "Vezetéknév" (last name): input element with id "billing_last_name"
> 
> - "Keresztnév" (first name): id "billing_first_name"
> 
> - "Irányítószám" (zip code): id "billing_postcode" (Ask if they want to use the zip they entered in the beginning)
> 
> - "Város" (city):  id "billing_city"
> 
> - "Utca, házszám" (address): id "billing_address_1"
> 
> - "Emelet, lépcsőház, lakás, stb. (nem kötelező)" (optional floor, door, flat, etc.): id "billing_address_2"
> 
> - "Telefonszám" (phone number): id "billing_phone"

> Perfect! I've created a comprehensive Python script that automates pizza ordering from capripizzeria.hu. Here's what the bot does:
> 
> Key Features:
> Zip Code Validation: Greets users and validates their zip code against the supported list
> Pizza Scraping: Automatically scrapes all available pizzas from multiple pages
> Fuzzy Search: Uses fuzzywuzzy to find closest pizza matches when exact names aren't provided
> Size & Quantity Selection: Handles pizza configuration with size options and quantity
> Multiple Orders: Allows ordering multiple pizzas in one session
> Shipping Details: Saves and reuses shipping information via JSON file
> Automated Checkout: Fills all required checkout form fields
> Order Total: Extracts and displays the final order amount
> How to Use:
> Install dependencies:
> pip install -r requirements.txt
> Make sure you have Chrome browser and ChromeDriver installed
> 
> Run the script:
> 
> python pizza_ordering_bot.py
> The script will guide you through each step interactively. It handles all the requirements you specified:
> 
> Validates zip codes and warns for unsupported areas
> Scrapes pizzas from paginated results until 404
> Uses fuzzy matching for pizza selection
> Handles size selection from dropdown menus
> Manages quantity input
> Adds items to cart
> Supports multiple pizza orders
> Fills checkout form with saved/new shipping details
> Extracts order total with currency
> The bot stops just before placing the final order, giving you control over the actual purchase. The browser stays open so you can review everything before completing the transaction.

> 
> Progress Bar Enhancements:
> Pizza Scraping Progress:
> 
> Shows progress across multiple pages
> Nested progress bar for processing pizzas on each page
> Estimates total pages for accurate progress tracking
> Pizza Configuration Progress:
> 
> Loading progress when navigating to pizza pages
> Progress tracking when adding items to cart
> Checkout Form Progress:
> 
> Progress bar when filling out form fields
> Shows which field is currently being filled
> Better Error Handling:
> 
> Uses tqdm.write() for error messages to avoid interfering with progress bars
> Key Features Added:
> Smart Page Detection: The bot now estimates total pages before scraping for accurate progress tracking
> Nested Progress Bars: Shows both page-level and pizza-level progress during scraping
> Real-time Updates: Progress descriptions update to show current operations
> Clean Output: Progress bars don't interfere with user input or error messages
> The progress bars make the bot much more user-friendly by showing:
> 
> How many pages are being scraped
> Current progress through form filling
> Loading states for page navigation
> Overall completion status
> Now when you run the bot, you'll see nice progress bars that keep you informed about what's happening, especially during the potentially slow pizza scraping phase!

> Multiple selectors: Instead of relying on just one CSS selector, it tries multiple common selectors for quantity inputs
> Always set quantity: Rather than only setting when quantity != 1, it always attempts to set the quantity, which ensures consistency
> Better element interaction: Uses element_to_be_clickable instead of just presence_of_element_located to ensure the element is ready for interaction
> Fallback method: If the normal clear/send_keys approach fails, it uses JavaScript to directly set the value
> Verification: Checks that the value was actually set correctly
> Improved error handling: More robust exception handling with multiple fallback attempts
> The key improvements are:
> 
> Trying multiple CSS selectors since different pizza pages might have different HTML structures
> Using JavaScript as a fallback to set the value directly
> Always attempting to set the quantity rather than skipping when it's 1
> Better verification that the quantity was actually set

> Perfect! I've cleaned up the debug information while keeping the working solution. The key improvements that made it work are:
> 
> Better element selection: Finds all matching elements and selects the first visible and enabled one
> User simulation: Uses click + Ctrl+A + type sequence to mimic real user interaction
> JavaScript fallback: If the user simulation doesn't work, it falls back to JavaScript with proper event triggering
> Clean verification: Simple check with appropriate user feedback
> The quantity setting should now work reliably for all pizza items in your ordering bot!

> Skip the entire quantity setting process when quantity is 1 (the default)
> Only perform the quantity setting logic when a different quantity is needed
> Show appropriate feedback messages for both cases

> Perfect! I've added code to scroll to the "Megrendelés" (Place Order) button at the end of the checkout form filling process. The code:
> 
> Finds the button using its ID place_order
> Scrolls it into view using scrollIntoView({block: 'center'}) to center it on the screen
> Adds a small delay for smooth scrolling
> Provides feedback about whether the button was found and scrolled to
> This will ensure that after all the form fields are filled and the terms are accepted, the user can clearly see the final "Megrendelés" button to complete their order.
